# ColorWheelHelper
A helper for Color Wheel from Looney Labs (https://www.looneylabs.com/content/color-wheel). I enjoy playing Color Wheel and other games from Looney Labs' Pyramid Arcade. I'd like a python tool that helps playing and explores the underlying math.

Ideas: 

•  Supply a setup for the desired difficulty.

•  Display a Color Wheel board (esthetically pleasing: not actually necessary).

•  Generate a Color Wheel difficulty metric (necessary for supplying a setup at a specified difficulty).
